1) Button class sizes not working when adding buttons inside of a div:
    class = "button-large"

2) Directions for how to use the Tabs component wasn't in their Components page documentation. But I found another "Tabs" instruction under the Javascript page documentation that worked.

3) Form input, select, and text area in mobile view defaulted way too small

4) Uncoil Hero component not fully responsive in mobile. Header text and button went outside the div and into the main content

5) Carrot for tool tip bubble not showing

6) Tool tip padding for hover content too small

7) Default lists styles didn't apply when I added inside content for Tabs component

8) Tabs component looks odd in mobile, but functions fine
